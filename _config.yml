author: Sangbum
author_bio: Hi, I am a <mark>VIO, SLAM</mark> engineer with a strong passion for robotics 🤖. I received my master's degree in the Navigation and Electronics System Lab (NESL) at Seoul National University. I specialize in designing probabilistic estimators using multiple programming languages, including <mark>C++</mark> and <mark>Python</mark> with <mark>ROS</mark> 👨🏻‍💻. While I have a few accepted papers, I take pride in developing my own code, which is available in my repositories. In addition to my SLAM works, I am capable of performing structural and aerodynamic analysis using CATIA and AutoCAD ⚙️.

  I am always open to collaboration and happy to discuss any of my previous work. Please feel free to reach out with any questions 👏👏.
