## About Me
I am a **Visual-Inertial SLAM** engineer from Korea with a strong passion for robotics 🤖. I am currently pursuing my master’s degree in the Navigation and Electronics System Lab (NESL) at Seoul National University. I specialize in designing probabilistic estimators using **C++**, **Python**, and **ROS** 👨🏻‍💻. While I have a few accepted papers, I take pride in developing my own code, which is available in my repositories. In addition to my SLAM work, I am capable of performing structural and aerodynamic analysis using CATIA and AutoCAD ⚙️.

I am always open to collaboration and happy to discuss any of my previous work. Please feel free to reach out with any questions 👏👏.

## Experience 🚀
### Research Member — Navigation and Electronics Lab. (NESL)  
*Sep. 2023 – Present*  
The Navigation and Electronics Lab (NESL) primarily focuses on researching integrated navigation systems, with recent expansions into SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping). Through my participation in a project with KARI, I contributed to the development of indoor and outdoor navigation technologies designed to perform effectively in unknown and challenging environments.  
My specialization lies in visual-inertial navigation systems. As highlighted in my accepted papers, I have focused on incorporating semantic information to improve the navigation accuracy of mobile platforms.

### H-Mobility: Autonomous Driving Course — Hyundai Motor Group  
*Mar. 2024 – Aug. 2024*  
This course covered the perception, control, and network systems of autonomous driving vehicles. Together with my teammates, I designed an integrated system using ROS 2 Humble and Python.  
For the implementation, YOLO-based instance segmentation and a bird’s-eye view transformation were employed to enable basic path planning and steering control. Signal communication was seamlessly managed through the DDS (Data Distribution Service) network architecture within ROS 2 Humble.

### Coursework (Selected)
- **Integrated Navigation System** — *A+* (Master, Seoul National University)  
- **Aerospace Estimation** — *A-* (Master, Seoul National University)  
- **System Engineering** — *A+* (Bachelor, Konkuk University)  
- **Control Engineering** — *A0* (Bachelor, Konkuk University)
